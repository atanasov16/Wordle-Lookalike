# Wordle-Lookalike
This is a Wordle lookalike game that its functionality was made in JavaScript.
First, a random 5 letter word is generated from the list at the start of the script (which can be updated at anytime) and then the person guesses the word.
Orange means that the target word contains the letter
Green means that the target word contains the letter and the letter is at the right spot.
If the player guesses the word, the background turns green and the game is won.
Otherwise the background turns red and the game is lost. 
#TODO add win/loss counter
